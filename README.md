Listaki is an app that solves one of the biggest modern problems!

If you think:

"Going to the grocery store or shopping mall and forgetting something you needed to buy."

You are wrong!!!!

The biggest problem is:

"My girlfriend forgot to add something she needed to buy to my notepad."

To solve this, we have two visions:

First: An offline app to create, read, update, and delete our lists and items.
Second: Sharing our lists with other people.

This app will be my MVP for the first vision.

Android app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, and Clean Architecture.
